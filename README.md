# Airfoil Self Noise Prediction

## **About Dataset**
### The original dataset was provided from the kaggle dataset: "NASA Airfoil Self-Noise Dataset"
### https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/airfoil-selfnoise-dataset?select=AirfoilSelfNoise.csv

## Context
### NASA dataset obtained from a series of aerodynamic and acoustic tests of two and three-dimensional airfoil blade sections conducted in an anechoic wind tunnel. 
### The data was obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/291/airfoil+self+noise

## Content
### The NASA data set comprises different size NACA 0012 airfoils (n0012-il) at various wind tunnel speeds and angles of attack. 
### The span of the airfoil and the observer position were the same in all of the experiments.

## **Attribute Information:**
## Input features:

### f: Frequency in Hertzs [Hz].
### alpha: Angle of attack (AoA, Œ±), in degrees [¬∞].
### c: Chord length, in meters [m].
### U_infinity: Free-stream velocity, in meters per second [m/s].
### delta: Suction side displacement thickness (ùõø), in meters [m].
### Output:
### SSPL: Scaled sound pressure level, in decibels [dB].
